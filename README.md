ITMD361 Lab 5 –CSS data table
Objective:
Create a valid, properly formatted HTML5 data table, fully styled with CSS.

Process:
1.   Create a new github repository for your lab 5.
2.   Create an external style sheet and link it to an html file.
3.   Use css to style the page and table. I don't want it to look like the default browser styling 
on anything. Use your own css, don't use the defaults from a css framework like bootstrap.
4.   Add some appropriate headlines, titles, and any other content you think is appropriate to the 
document.
5.   Get data from here:  http://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/special/planets.htm
6.   Use any 4 of the full planets (not pluto or small bodies).
7.   Combine the data from any 4 planet pages into a single html page with one single table. I do 
not want separate tables/pages.
8.   Data attributes or the planet names can be on either horizontal or vertical axis. However you 
want to format it.
9.   Use first seven data fields: Mass, Diameter, Mean density, Escape velocity, Avg Dist from sun, 
Rotation period, Revolution period.
10. Grading will be based on requirements and how well it is styled. Try to use images and various 
css properties to make your page look nice and unique.
11. Goal is to show the data in a nice, readable and pleasant way in a combined table on a single 
page.
12. DO NOT just use a css framework like bootstrap for all your css.

This lab will be graded based on how well you follow the directions, how your HTML syntax looks, 
how your CSS syntax looks, and if you completed all the requested items. Syntax errors, missing 
requirements, and deviations from the directions will result in deducted points.

A very simply styled page in the top corner of the web page will not receive all the points. Try to 
make the page look fully styled and not like any browser default.
Apply CSS properties to the table via classes or ids on elements. I would also suggest trying to 
make a css layout like the 960 centered we demoed in class to structure your page. Add as much 
styling as you can. Anything you can add to the page to make it look nice and different will be 
good.

Everybody’s page and tables should look unique. This is not a group project.
Due date is on the Syllabus.
